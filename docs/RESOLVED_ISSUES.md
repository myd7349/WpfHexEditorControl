# Resolved Issues - V2.2.1

This document tracks critical issues that have been resolved in WPF HexEditor V2.

## Issue #145: Insert Mode Hex Input Bug ✅ RESOLVED

**Status**: Completely resolved (2026-02-14)
**Severity**: High - Critical usability issue
**Milestone**: v2.5.0

### Problem Description

When typing consecutive hex characters in **Insert Mode** (e.g., "FFFFFFFF"), the HexEditorV2 control produced incorrect byte sequences. Instead of pairing hex characters to form complete bytes like "FF FF FF FF", it created incomplete bytes with only the high nibble set: "F0 F0 F0 F0".

### User Impact

- Insert mode was nearly unusable for hex input
- Users could not type hex pairs naturally
- Expected behavior (FF FF FF FF) did not match actual behavior (F0 F0 F0 F0)
- Bug affected both hex panel and ASCII panel

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue was traced to a critical bug in **`PositionMapper.PhysicalToVirtual()`** at lines 278-290:

```csharp
// BEFORE (WRONG):
if (physicalPosition == segment.PhysicalPos)
{
    virtualPos = segment.VirtualOffset;  // ❌ Returns position of FIRST inserted byte
    return virtualPos;
}

// AFTER (CORRECT):
if (physicalPosition == segment.PhysicalPos)
{
    // Physical byte is AFTER all insertions
    virtualPos = segment.VirtualOffset + segment.InsertedCount;  // ✅ Returns position of physical byte
    return virtualPos;
}
```

**Why this caused the bug:**
1. When `PhysicalToVirtual` returned the position of the first inserted byte instead of the physical byte position, it caused `ByteReader` to calculate incorrect `relativePosition` values
2. This triggered workaround logic that read **physical bytes** instead of **inserted bytes**
3. Result: User saw physical byte values (F0 pattern) instead of the inserted values (FF bytes)

### Virtual Space Layout

With 1 insertion at physical position 52:
```
Virtual Layout: [Insert0 at virtual 52] [PhysicalByte at virtual 53]
                 ^segment.VirtualOffset  ^Correct PhysicalToVirtual result
```

The bug returned virtual position 52 instead of 53, causing out-of-range calculations.

### Fixes Applied

#### Fix 1: Cursor Position Synchronization (Commit 35b19b5)
**Location**: `HexEditorV2.xaml.cs` lines ~5987-6010

**Changes:**
- Added `Dispatcher.Invoke(DispatcherPriority.Send)` for synchronous cursor updates
- Added drift tolerance (±1 position) in Insert mode to handle async position updates

**Result**: Cursor position tracking works correctly

#### Fix 2: LIFO Offset Calculation in ByteProvider (Commit 35b19b5)
**Location**: `ByteProvider.cs` lines ~246-264

**Problem**: Insertions stored in LIFO (stack) order with newest at offset 0, but code assumed FIFO order

**Changes:**
```csharp
int totalInsertions = _editsManager.GetInsertionCountAt(physicalPos.Value);
int virtualOffset = totalInsertions - 1 - (int)(virtualPosition - virtualStart);  // LIFO inversion
```

**Result**: Modifications to inserted bytes now target correct byte in LIFO array

#### Fix 3: PhysicalToVirtual Calculation (ROOT CAUSE) (Commit 405b164)
**Location**: `PositionMapper.cs` lines 278-290

**Critical change**: Return `segment.VirtualOffset + segment.InsertedCount` instead of `segment.VirtualOffset`

**Result**:
- `PhysicalToVirtual` now consistently returns correct virtual position
- ByteReader calculates correct `relativePosition` values
- Workaround logic no longer triggers
- Inserted bytes display with proper values

### Testing Results

✅ All acceptance criteria met:
1. ✅ Typing "FFFFFFFF" produces: `FF FF FF FF` (4 complete bytes)
2. ✅ Typing "12345678" produces: `12 34 56 78` (4 complete bytes)
3. ✅ Typing single 'F' produces: `F0` (1 incomplete byte, expected)
4. ✅ Cursor remains at correct position after each nibble
5. ✅ Works consistently regardless of typing speed
6. ✅ Works in both hex panel and ASCII panel
7. ✅ Green highlighting shows inserted bytes correctly
8. ✅ No crashes, no phantom bytes, no workarounds triggered

## Save Data Loss Bug ✅ COMPLETELY RESOLVED

**Status**: Completely resolved and validated (2026-02-14)
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Permanent data loss
**Milestone**: v2.5.0

### Problem Description

When saving a file after inserting bytes in **Insert Mode**, the save operation destroyed most of the file content, reducing multi-megabyte files to a few hundred bytes.

**Examples:**
- 2.92 MB (3,064,767 bytes) → 752 bytes after save ❌
- 921 KB file → 240 bytes after save ❌
- 4.2 MB file → 1 KB after save ❌

### User Impact

- **PERMANENT DATA LOSS** - Original files destroyed
- Insert Mode completely unusable for production work
- Loss of user trust and data integrity

### Root Cause Analysis

The **same PositionMapper bug** that caused Issue #145 also caused the Save data loss:

**The Save Process:**
1. `ByteProvider.SaveAs()` calls `GetBytes()` in 64KB chunks
2. `GetBytes()` delegates to `ByteReader.GetBytes()`
3. `ByteReader.ReadByteInternal()` reads each virtual byte
4. For inserted bytes, calculates offset using `PhysicalToVirtual()`
5. Looks up byte in LIFO insertion array by VirtualOffset

**The Bug:**
- When `PhysicalToVirtual()` returned wrong virtual position (first inserted byte instead of physical byte)
- ByteReader calculated incorrect `relativePosition` and `targetOffset`
- Lookup failed or returned wrong byte
- `ReadByteInternal()` returned `(0, false)` indicating failure
- Save operation wrote truncated data

**Result**: Most bytes failed to read, file saved with only partial data.

### Fixes Applied

#### Fix 1: PositionMapper.PhysicalToVirtual (ROOT CAUSE) (Commit 405b164)
**Same fix as Issue #145** - Return position of physical byte, not first inserted byte

**Impact**: This fix resolves the root cause of Save data loss

#### Fix 2: ByteReader LIFO Offset Calculation (Commit 405b164)
**Location**: `ByteReader.cs` lines 76-156

**Changes:**
1. Updated virtual space layout understanding to match PositionMapper semantics
2. Corrected LIFO offset calculation using proper `firstInsertedVirtualPos`
3. Removed performance-heavy diagnostic logging

**Result**: ByteReader now correctly reads inserted bytes during Save operations

#### Fix 3: ByteProvider LIFO Offset Calculation (Commit 35b19b5)
**Location**: `ByteProvider.cs` lines 264-300

**Changes:**
1. Updated virtual space layout understanding
2. Corrected LIFO offset for ModifyInsertedByte operations

**Result**: Modifications to inserted bytes work correctly

### Expected Results

With the PositionMapper fix, ByteReader should now correctly read inserted bytes during Save operations:

1. ✅ Save with insertions → file size = original + inserted bytes
2. ✅ Save with deletions → file size = original - deleted bytes
3. ✅ Save with modifications → file size = original (unchanged)
4. ✅ Save with mixed edits → correct file size and content
5. ✅ After save, reopen file → content matches virtual view before save
6. ✅ Large file test (multi-MB with 100+ insertions) → no data loss

### Validation Tests

✅ **ALL TESTS PASSED** - Comprehensive real-world validation completed (2026-02-14):
1. ✅ Save file with byte insertions - file size and content verified correct
2. ✅ Save file with byte deletions - file size and content verified correct
3. ✅ Save file with byte modifications only - file size unchanged, verified correct
4. ✅ Save file with mix of insertions, deletions, and modifications - ALL verified correct
5. ✅ After save, reopen and verify content byte-by-byte - matches perfectly
6. ✅ Performance: Fast save path for modification-only edits (10-100x faster)

## Related Issues

Both issues shared the **same root cause**: critical bug in `PositionMapper.PhysicalToVirtual()`.

### Common Root Cause

The bug in PositionMapper affected:
1. **Display/Rendering** → Issue #145 (F0 display bug)
2. **Save Operations** → Save data loss bug

**Single fix resolved both**: Commit 405b164 corrected PhysicalToVirtual calculation.

### Lessons Learned

1. **Architecture matters**: A single incorrect assumption in position mapping cascaded through multiple components
2. **LIFO complexity**: Stack-based insertion storage is non-intuitive and error-prone
3. **Diagnostic logging**: Detailed logging was critical to identifying the root cause
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive architecture docs (ARCHITECTURE_V2.md) help prevent similar bugs
5. **Testing**: Need comprehensive integration tests for Save operations with complex edit scenarios

### Future Improvements

- [ ] Add comprehensive Save integration tests
- [ ] Consider FIFO insertion storage for simpler semantics (breaking change)
- [ ] Add validation checks in SaveAs to detect truncated writes
- [ ] Add unit tests for PositionMapper edge cases
- [ ] Add assertions to catch position mapping errors early
