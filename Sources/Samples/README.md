## 📚 Learning Path

**Recommended order for learning:**

1. **Start with:** `WPFHexEditor.Sample.CSharp`
   Learn the basics: opening files, editing, copy/paste, undo/redo

2. **Next:** `WpfHexEditor.Sample.InsertByteAnywhere`
   Learn advanced editing: insertion, deletion, dynamic modifications

3. **Then:** `WpfHexEditor.Sample.BarChart`
   Learn data visualization and analysis techniques

4. **Advanced:** `WpfHexEditor.Sample.BinaryFilesDifference`
   Learn file comparison and custom rendering

5. **Integration:** `WpfHexEditor.Sample.AvalonDock`
   Learn professional UI integration patterns

6. **Cross-platform:** `WpfHexEditor.Sample.Winform`
   Learn WPF/WinForms interoperability

## 🎨 Common Code Patterns

### Opening a File
```csharp
hexEditor.FileName = @"C:\path\to\file.bin";
```

### Programmatic Selection
```csharp
hexEditor.SelectionStart = 0x100;
hexEditor.SelectionStop = 0x1FF;
```

### Finding Data
```csharp
byte[] searchData = new byte[] { 0x48, 0x65, 0x6C, 0x6C, 0x6F }; // "Hello"
long position = hexEditor.FindFirst(searchData);
```

### Custom Character Table
```csharp
hexEditor.LoadTblFile(@"C:\path\to\custom.tbl");
```

### Handling Events
```csharp
hexEditor.SelectionStartChanged += (s, e) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Selection at: 0x{hexEditor.SelectionStart:X}");
};
```

## 🛠️ Architecture Integration

All samples now use the new **Service-based Architecture**:
- `ClipboardService` - Copy/paste operations
- `FindReplaceService` - Search with optimized caching
- `UndoRedoService` - Undo/redo history management
- `SelectionService` - Selection validation and manipulation

See [Services/README.md](../WPFHexaEditor/Services/README.md) for details.

## 💡 Tips

- **Performance:** For large files (>100MB), consider using `AllowVisualByteAdress` to view only a portion
- **Custom TBL:** Create your own character tables for game modding or proprietary formats
- **Events:** Subscribe to events like `BytesModified`, `SelectionChanged` for reactive UI
- **Theming:** Customize colors via properties like `ForegroundSecondColor`, `SelectionFirstColor`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Sample won't build
**Solution:** Ensure you're targeting .NET 8.0-windows or .NET Framework 4.8

**Issue:** File won't open
**Solution:** Check file permissions and that the file exists

**Issue:** High memory usage
**Solution:** Use `AllowVisualByteAdress` for large files
