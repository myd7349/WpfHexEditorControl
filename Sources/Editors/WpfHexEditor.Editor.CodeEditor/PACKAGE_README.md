# WpfCodeEditor

A full-featured WPF code editor UserControl for .NET 8. Built as part of the [WpfHexEditorControl](https://github.com/abbaye/WpfHexEditorIDE) project.

```
dotnet add package WpfCodeEditor
```

## What's New in 0.9.6.6

- **Fix**: SmartComplete popup no longer steals keyboard focus. The suggestion list is non-focusable — caret blink and word-highlight timers are never interrupted. Up/Down/PageUp/PageDown/Home/End/Enter/Tab/Escape are forwarded from the editor to the popup.
- **Fix**: `CodeEditorSplitHost` — IDE docking focus (Focus() on the Grid container) is correctly routed to the active editor via `OnGotKeyboardFocus`. Secondary editor `ModifiedChanged` is now wired. `IsDirty`, `Save`, and `SaveAsync` always delegate to the primary editor (which owns the file path).
- **Fix**: Word-highlight feedback loop eliminated — cursor position is tracked before `InvalidateRegion`, preventing a second 250ms debounce cycle from firing on every arrow-key press.
- **Fix**: Arrow-key navigation now triggers `NotifyCursorMoved()` so word-highlight updates without waiting for the next render frame.
- **Fix**: Save guard — writing an empty buffer over a non-empty file on disk is blocked with a status message (prevents data loss from timing races during `OpenAsync`).
- **Fix**: LSP burst-init dispatcher calls downgraded to `DispatcherPriority.Background` so Roslyn workspace startup does not block WPF frame rendering.
- **New**: `EnableWordHighlight` setting — toggle occurrence highlighting via the Code Editor options page or `CodeEditorDefaultSettings.EnableWordHighlight`.

## What's New in 0.9.6.5

- **Fix**: LSP inlay hints and declaration hints (code lens) no longer render as ghost overlays on top of code text. Hints now correctly align with the text area origin, accounting for gutter offset, top margin, and horizontal scroll.
- **Fix**: ReadOnly mode no longer blocks text selection and caret placement. Only text modification is blocked — selection (Shift+Arrow, drag), caret click, copy (Ctrl+C), and select all (Ctrl+A) now work as expected.

## Quick Start

### CodeEditorSplitHost (full-featured: syntax highlighting, LSP, folding...)

```xml
<Window xmlns:ce="clr-namespace:WpfHexEditor.Editor.CodeEditor.Controls;assembly=WpfHexEditor.Editor.CodeEditor">
    <ce:CodeEditorSplitHost x:Name="Editor" />
</Window>
```

```csharp
// Load a file
Editor.PrimaryEditor.LoadText(File.ReadAllText("Program.cs"));
Editor.SetLanguage(languageDefinition);
```

### TextEditor (lightweight, plain text)

```xml
<Window xmlns:te="clr-namespace:WpfHexEditor.Editor.TextEditor;assembly=WpfHexEditor.Editor.TextEditor">
    <te:TextEditor x:Name="TextEdit" />
</Window>
```

```csharp
// Load plain text
TextEdit.LoadText(File.ReadAllText("notes.txt"));

// Read back
string content = TextEdit.Text;
```

The `TextEditor` control is a lightweight plain-text editor included in the package. Use `CodeEditorSplitHost` when you need syntax highlighting, folding, and LSP support.
